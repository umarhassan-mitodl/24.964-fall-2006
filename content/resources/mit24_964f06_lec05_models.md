description: Lecture notes on models of phonetic realization, rules and constraints,
  phonetics-phonology interaction, targets and interpolation, locus equations, vowel
  target undershoot, undershoot as a consequence of effort minimization, a constraint-based
  model, finding optimal values, and weighted constraints versus ranked constraints.
