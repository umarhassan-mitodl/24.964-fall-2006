As a graduate seminar focused primarily on critical reading of assigned texts and in-depth class discussion, class assignments consist of the following:

1.  Class participation: students are expected to complete the readings and participate actively in class discussions.
2.  A presentation for the class analyzing one of the assigned readings.
3.  A final paper on a topic related to this course, selected in consultation with the instructor.
